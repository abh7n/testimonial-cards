                    <p>Since starting my career in 2021, I have only followed one resource, roadmap.sh, it truly helped
                        me go from 0 to having a job and changing the financial trajectory of my family.</p>

                <p>I find myself recommending roadmap.sh to all the internees or junior developers. It's a great way to
                    skill up and grow in your career.</p>

                <p>roadmap.sh is an incredible resource. I was fortunate to discover it during my university days in
                    2018. Back then, it was just a single repository with three images. It's amazing to see how much
                    impact it has had on millions of lives since then. </p>
